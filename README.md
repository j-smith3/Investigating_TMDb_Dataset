# Investigating_TMDb_Dataset
I investigated the TMDb movie data-set to identify trends that exist in movies. 

The dataset consists of movies that were released prior to 2016 and some general information about each movie; including budget and popularity rating.

My investigation looked into the relationship between a movies budget and its popularity score.
