## About

I investigated the TMDb movie data-set to identify trends that exist in movies. 

The dataset consists of movies that were released prior to 2016 and some general information about each movie; including budget, profits, expenses and popularity rating.

My investigation focused on the relationship between a movies expenses/profits and its popularity score.
