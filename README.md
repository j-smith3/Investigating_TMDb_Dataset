# Investigating_TMDb_Dataset
Investigated the TMDb movie dataset to identify trends that exist between attributes. 

The dataset consists of movies that were released prior to 2016 and some general information about each movie; including budget and popularity rating.

My investigation looked into the relationship between a movies budget and its popularity score.
